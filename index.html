    <h3> My Coding and KWK Journey!</h3>
    <p> I first learned to code in freshman year of high school when I took Intro to Programming.
        The summer of going into Sophmore year, I became a KWK scholar and participated in the virtual Web Development camp. 
        During sophmore year, I continued my coding journey in school and took AP CSA. The rest of my summers until 
        I hit the age limit, I continued to participate in KWK as a scholar. 
        I got the opportunity to go in person the rest of the summers in NYC and it was so much fun! </p>

        <p>Below is my KWK journey list and I'm excited to continue my KWK alumni journey! </p>
